<h1>WHAT ARE CIRCLE GAMES ?</h1>

<p>Circle Games are an exciting selection of puzzle, response, and collaborative Interactive games that can be played online for free. These games are ideal for individuals who think in a circular rather than predictable sequence. The games feature catching circles, moving in circular patterns to achieve goals, or expanding as a circle.</p>
<br>

<p1>Simply roll around as a circle on the two games created, crushing your opponents by using keys and collecting larger circles to beat the score. Browse through my cool collection of Circle Games that I designed, pick your personal best, and have a great time. When you're done, just start over since a circle has no endpoint. Isn't that amazing? Have fun with my two fantastic games, Circle Rush and Crazy Circles.</p1>
